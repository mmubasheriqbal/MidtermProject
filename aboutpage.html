        <div class = "c">
        <p> Hi! My name is Mubasher Iqbal and I am a junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi. This website has been made for a midterm project for the "Intro to Web Develpoment" class taught by Professor Kathryn Adee at NYU Tandon. Being a huge movie buff, I decided to make movie reviews as the topic for this project. However, as of this moment, the reviews on this website are NOT my own.</p>
