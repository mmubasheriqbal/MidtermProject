I was able to find a good tutorial on w3 schools, that enabled me to make my desire drop down menu. The key is that each process/step of a drop down menu has to be broken down into classes, and then each attributes can be assigned to each class according to our specifications. For instance, in this case we have a normal looking button that changes when the mouse hovers over it. At the same time a menu drops down with different options to select. This requires four different classes. Then as the mouse hovers over each option, the appearance of the option changes too. This requires two more classes. Combining all of this with a position-fixing class, and you have a total of 7 classes controlling one drop down menu. 
 
 The prevailing issue throughout the project was ensuring spacing between different elemnts (text, boxes and images). Another issue was the different types of fonts, colors and sizes I was using to decorate my text. Classes had to be defined separately in the CSS file to ensure that the heading was in the center, while the text was alligned to the right.
 
 In addition to learning how to make drop down menus, I got to thorougly learn abot element placement on the screen. Wrapping image around text.
